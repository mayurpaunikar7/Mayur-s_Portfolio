# [project 1: Swiggy Recommendation Model Project](https://github.com/mayurpaunikar7/Swiggy-Reccomendation-Model-)

In this project, I developed a recommendation model for aspiring restaurant owners looking to open a new restaurant in Bangalore 
using data scraped from Swiggy, a popular food delivery platform. The project involves data extraction, preprocessing, analysis, 
visualization, and the implementation of machine learning algorithms to provide insights and recommendations.

# [Project 2: Netflix User Behaviour Analysis EDA](https://github.com/mayurpaunikar7/Netflix-User-Behaviour-Analysis)

Netflix is facing increasing competition from other streaming services, such as Disney+, HBO Max, and Amazon Prime Video.
In order to stay ahead of the competition, Netflix needs to understand its users' behavior and preferences better.
This will help Netflix to create content that its users will enjoy and to target its marketing campaigns more effectively

# [Project 3: Customer Behavior and Business Analysis: SQL Analytics](https://github.com/mayurpaunikar7/customer-behavior-sql-analytics)

This project delves into the analysis of customer buying behavior, company behavior, sales, profits, losses, and various business metrics. 
The primary objective is to extract valuable insights from the dataset using SQL queries and provide meaningful answers to critical business questions. 
Leveraging SQL, Python, and data visualization techniques, this project aims to empower decision-makers with data-driven insights.

# Project Overview

- **Data Structure**: The dataset comprises multiple interconnected tables, including customers, orders, order details, products,
- categories, payments, shippers, and suppliers. These tables are linked through Primary Keys (PK) and Foreign Keys (FK).
