# [project 1: Swiggy Recommendation Model Project](https://github.com/mayurpaunikar7/Swiggy-Reccomendation-Model-)

In this project, I developed a recommendation model for aspiring restaurant owners looking to open a new restaurant in Bangalore 
using data scraped from Swiggy, a popular food delivery platform. The project involves data extraction, preprocessing, analysis, 
visualization, and the implementation of machine learning algorithms to provide insights and recommendations.

## Project Overview

- **Objective**: Develop a recommendation model for restaurant owners in Bangalore.
- **Data Source**: Scrape data from Swiggy using Python.
- **Libraries Used**: NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib.
- **Machine Learning Algorithms**: RandomForestRegressor, GradientBoostingRegressor.
- **Recommendation Model**: Predict preferred price and suggest a suitable location based on cuisine and price.



# [Project 2: Netflix User Behaviour Analysis EDA](https://github.com/mayurpaunikar7/Netflix-User-Behaviour-Analysis)

Netflix is facing increasing competition from other streaming services, such as Disney+, HBO Max, and Amazon Prime Video.
In order to stay ahead of the competition, Netflix needs to understand its users' behavior and preferences better.
This will help Netflix to create content that its users will enjoy and to target its marketing campaigns more effectively

## Project Overview

- **Data Source**: Data was taken from Kaggle dataset.

- **Objective**: This project dives into the world of Netflix user behavior using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

- **Libraries Used**: Leveraging Python libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.

- **Implications**: The project's findings have implications for content creators, marketers, and platform optimization.

- **Significance**: Understanding user preferences and behaviors can aid in tailoring content offerings and enhancing user experience.
